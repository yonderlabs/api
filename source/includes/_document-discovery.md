**Suggest other documents relevant to your text from a Text Collection**

Based on the provided text, this API suggests other contextually relevant documents by retrieving them from a Text Collection.

<aside class="notice">
Depending on the size of the Text Collection, this service might take up to few minutes to provide a full answer.

### Discover related documents in a Collection - `POST fromURL` 

Given an URL, this API allows you to discover other contextually relevant documents by retrieving them from a Text Collection.
As detailed in the right panel, as an immediate response to this API, you will get a `202` answer ("ACCEPTED") containing a task identifier `task_id` to be used later in the `GET` call. 

Parameter | Type | Description | Values |
--------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
collection_name | string, required | the name of the Text Collection  | - |
url | string, required |the url of the text | use [url-encoding](http://www.url-encode-decode.com/)|
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) | - |

### Discover related documents in a Collection - `POST fromText` 

Given a text, this API allows you to discover other contextually relevant documents by retrieving them from a Text Collection.
As detailed in the right panel, as an immediate response to this API, you will get a `202` answer ("ACCEPTED") containing a task identifier `task_id` to be used later in the `GET` call.

Parameter | Type | Description | Values |
--------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
collection_name | string, required | the name of the Text Collection | - |
text | string, required |the text document | pass the text between "" (e.g. "This is an example") or use [url-encoded](http://www.url-encode-decode.com/) text|
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) | - |

### Get results from Document Discovery - `GET` 

This API allows you to retrieve all correlated documents contained in a Text Collection.


Parameter | Type | Description | 
--------- | ------- | ----------- | 
task_id | string, required | the identifier of the created Document Discovery task| 
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) | 

If results are ready (i.e. document similarities have been computed) you will get a `200` answer ("SUCCESS") and the resulting ouput, as detailed in the right panel.
If the process is still ongoing you will get an adequate status code answer ("STARTED" or "PENDING") meaning that you have to try again a bit later with another `GET` call. 

<aside class="notice">
In case of SUCCESS, results are promptly deleted afterwards, i.e. performing another GET on the same task_id will return no results.
