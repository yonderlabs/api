**Find other relevant entities not in your text from a Text Collection**

Based on the submitted text, this API finds contextually relevant named entities originally not in your text, by mining them from a Text Collection.

<aside class="notice">
Depending on the size of the Text Collection, this service might take up to few seconds to provide a full answer. 
</aside>


### Discover related entities from a Collection - `POST fromURL` 

Given an URL, this API allows you to discover other contextually relevant named entities by retrieving them from a Text Collection.
As detailed in the right panel, as an immediate response to this API, you will get a `202` answer ("ACCEPTED") containing a task identifier `task_id` to be used later in the `GET` call. 

Please notice that the `--include` in the `POST` call displays the response header, which includes the `API-instance` field. The value of `API-instance` field (e.g. `instance01`) must be included later in the following `GET` call.

Parameter | Type | Description | Values |
--------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
collection_name | string, required | the name of the Text Collection  | - |
url | string, required |the url of the text | use [url-encoding](http://www.url-encode-decode.com/)|
limit | number, optional | the max # of relevant entities to be returned | If not specified, all results are returned |
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) | - |

Parameter | Type | Description | Values |
--------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
collection_name | string, required | the name of the Text Collection | - |
text | string, required |the text document | pass the text between "" (e.g. "This is an example") or use [url-encoded](http://www.url-encode-decode.com/) text|
limit | number, optional | the max # of relevant entities to be returned | If not specified, all results are returned |
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) | - |




### Get results from Entity Discovery - `GET` 

This API allows you to get results containing relevant named entities discovered in a Text Collection.
Please notice that the value of the `API-instance` field shown in the response header of the previous `POST` call (e.g. `instance01`) must be included in the `GET` call after the option `--header`, as detailed in the right panel.


Parameter | Type | Description | 
--------- | ------- | ----------- | 
task_id | string, required | the identifier of the created Entity Discovery task| 
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) | 

If results are ready (i.e. the graph-related entities have been computed) you will get a `200` answer ("SUCCESS") and the resulting ouput, as detailed in the right panel.
If the process is still ongoing you will get an adequate status code answer ("STARTED" or "PENDING") meaning that you have to try again a bit later with another `GET` call. 

<aside class="notice">
In case of SUCCESS, results are promptly deleted afterwards, i.e. performing another GET on the same task_id will return no results.
