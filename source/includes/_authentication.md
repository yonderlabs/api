# Authentication

To use YonderAPI you need to first register at our [website](http://yonderlabs.com/api/#try) and get your credentials, i.e. `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD`.
YonderAPI expects for the credentials assigned in the registration process to be included in all API requests to the server.

The communication happens through a secure `https` connection, forced by the `--ssl-reqd` option.</aside>
