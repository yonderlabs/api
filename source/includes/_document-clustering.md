**Cluster text documents in your Text Collection**

This API analyzes a collection of texts and clusters documents according to their similarities.


<aside class="notice">
Depending on the size of the Text Collection, this service might take up to few minutes to provide a full answer. 
</aside>

### Launch a Document Clustering - `POST`

This API allows you to launch the task which computes document clusters on all  the items contained in a Text Collection.
As detailed in the right panel, as an immediate response to this API, you will get a `202` answer ("ACCEPTED") containing a task identifier `task_id` to be used later in the `GET` call. 


Parameter | Type | Description | 
--------- | ------- | ----------- | 
collection_name | string, required | the name of the Text Collection on which to lauch Document Clustering | 
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) |


### Get results from Document Clustering - `GET`

This API allows you to retrieve computed document clusters contained in a Text Collection.


Parameter | Type | Description | 
--------- | ------- | ----------- | 
task_id | string, required | the identifier of the created Document Clustering task| 
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) |

If results are ready (i.e. document clusters have been computed) you will get a `200` answer ("SUCCESS") and the resulting ouput, as detailed in the right panel.
If the process is still ongoing you will get an adequate status code answer ("STARTED" or "PENDING") meaning that you have to try again a bit later with another `GET` call. 

<aside class="notice">
In case of SUCCESS, results are promptly deleted afterwards, i.e. performing another GET on the same task_id will return no results.
