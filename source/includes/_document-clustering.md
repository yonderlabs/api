**Cluster text documents in your Text Collection**

This API analyzes a collection of texts and clusters documents according to their similarities.


<aside class="notice">
Depending on the size of the Text Collection, this service might take up to few minutes to provide a full answer. 
</aside>

### Launch a Document Clustering - `POST`

This API allows you to launch the task which computes document clusters on all  the items contained in a Text Collection.
As detailed in the right panel, as an immediate response to this API, you will get a `202` answer ("ACCEPTED") containing a task identifier `task_id` to be used later in the `GET` call. 

Please notice that the `--include` in the `POST` call displays the response header, which includes the `API-instance` field. The value of `API-instance` field (e.g. `instance01`) must be included later in the following `GET` call.

Parameter | Type | Description | 
--------- | ------- | ----------- | 
collection_name | string, required | the name of the Text Collection on which to lauch Document Clustering | 
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) |


### Get results from Document Clustering - `GET`

This API allows you to retrieve computed document clusters contained in a Text Collection.
Please notice that the value of the `API-instance` field shown in the response header of the previous `POST` call (e.g. `instance01`) must be included in the `GET` call after the option `--header`, as detailed in the right panel.


Parameter | Type | Description | 
--------- | ------- | ----------- | 
task_id | string, required | the identifier of the created Document Clustering task| 
access_token | string, required | your access token (40 digits) |

If results are ready (i.e. document clusters have been computed) you will get a `200` answer ("SUCCESS") and the resulting ouput, as detailed in the right panel.
Please notice that, in case duplicates or near-duplicates are found, these are listed in the dedicated field `near_duplicates`.

If the process is still ongoing you will get an adequate status code answer ("STARTED" or "PENDING") meaning that you have to try again a bit later with another `GET` call. 

<aside class="notice">
In case of SUCCESS, results are promptly deleted afterwards, i.e. performing another GET on the same task_id will return no results.
