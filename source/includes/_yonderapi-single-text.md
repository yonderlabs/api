#API on Text Documents

The following set of API allows for extracting semantic information from Text Documents. If you need to create a Text Collection, i.e. a repository of metadata coming from multiple texts useful for analyzing inter-documents relations (e.g. for measuring document similarities), please refer below to YonderAPI Text Collections.
