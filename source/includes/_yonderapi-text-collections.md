# API on Text Collections

The following set of API allows for storing metadata of a set of documents from which it is possible to explore inter-document relations (e.g. compare them, build graphs, or search for concepts across them). If you need to analyze documents without storing indexes please refer to YonderAPI on Text Documents provided above.


<aside class="notice">
PRIVACY - All created collections are private, i.e. they are accessible only by the user who created them. Furthermore for preserving your privacy we delete the texts of your documents from our systems keeping only associated metadata.
