# YonderAPI - Text Collections (coming soon)

The following set of API allows for storing **a set of text documents** and extracting semantic information from them (e.g. comparing them, or searching for concepts across them). 

<aside class="warning">
If you need to analyze just one document please refer to YonderAPI Text provided above.

All created collections are **private**, i.e. they are accessible only by the user who created them. For demonstrative purposes you can access two public Text Collections created by Yonder on [English news](English news) and on [Italian news](Italian news). 

<aside class="notice">
PRIVACY - For preserving your privacy we delete the texts of your documents from our systems keeping only associated metadata to perform other operations (comparisons, mining, etc.).
